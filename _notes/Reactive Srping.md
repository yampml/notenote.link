## The term "reactive"
- Reactive Systems - Architecture and Design
	-	ie Cloud Native

-	Reactive Programming
	-	Generally Event Based

- Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)
	-	Often confused with Reactive Programming


## Reactive Manifesto
-	Responsive
-	Resilient
-	Message Driven
-	Elastic

## What is Reactive Programming
-	Reactive Programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm focused on streams of data.
-	Common use cases:
	-	External Service Calls
	-	Highly Concurrent Message Consumers
	-	Spreadsheets
	-	Abstraction Over Asynchronous Processing
		-	Abstract whether or not your program is synchronous or asynchronous

### Features of Reactive Programming
-	Data Streams
-	Asynchronous
-	Non-blocking
-	Backpressure:
	-	The ability of the subscriber to throttle data.
-	Failures as messages

### Observer Pattern

### Reactive Streams API
- Publisher
- Subscriber
- Subscription
- Processor
